Basic Genetic Algorithm using a fitness function

A population of dots finding it's way to a certain goal and avoiding obstacles. Evolution based only on fitness function. No neural network involved in this simple example.

The code was inspired by the second AI tutorial from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q)
